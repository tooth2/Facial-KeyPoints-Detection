# Facial-KeyPoints-Detection
Applied image processing techniques and deep learning techniques to detect faces in an image and find facial keypoints. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on any face and are used in many applications, from facial tracking to emotion recognition. 

*Objective*
*image processing and feature extraction techniques to programmatically represent different facial features
*deep learning techniques to program a convolutional neural network to recognize facial keypoints
